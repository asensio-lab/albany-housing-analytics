TO CREATE JUNCTION TABLE and match primary id to addresses in housing and utilities data set:
prereqs: 
TotalUtilities.csv
TotalHouse.csv
csvs from geocoding in dropbox

1. run create_junction_table_csv.py to create the junction table from the geocoded csvs
   run addr_split_block.py to fix the issue where geocoding records data at block level, where we need block group

2. run map_addr_key_utilities.py to match up the utilities with the junction table. Addresses in the utilities dataset are brought into line with the junction table using functions imported from fix_addresses_master.py. Addresses which still cannot be matched are coded as NOT FOUND

3. run map_addr_key_housing.py to match up the housing projects with the junction table. Addresses in the housing projects dataset are brought into line with the junction table using functions imported from fix_addresses_master.py. Addresses which still cannot be matched are coded as NOT FOUND


3. run map_addr_key_tax.py to match up the tax with the junction table. Addresses in the tax dataset are brought into line with the junction table using functions imported from fix_addresses_master.py. Addresses which still cannot be matched are coded as NOT FOUND
